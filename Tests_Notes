    Types of software tests
#----------------------------
There are many different types of software tests, including:

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions in isolation. They ensure that each small part of the software performs as intended. By verifying the correctness of these individual units, we can catch errors early in the development process.

Integration tests check how different parts of the code e.g. functions work together.

Regression tests are used to ensure that new changes or updates to the codebase do not adversely affect the existing functionality. They involve checking whether a program or part of a program still generates the same results after changes have been made.

End-to-end tests are a special type of integration testing which checks that a program as a whole behaves as expected.
